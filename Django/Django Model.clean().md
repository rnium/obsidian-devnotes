## Override this method in a Model Class to provide application lavel validation of a data

##### I was writting a constraint which refers to a foreign key object's field. It does not work. So I came to know `clean()` method



***An Introduction by ChatGPT:***

`Model.clean()` is a method in Django models that allows you to perform custom validation and cleaning of model fields before the model instance is saved to the database. It is part of Django's model instance validation process and provides a way to enforce data integrity rules and perform additional checks on the model's data at the application level.

a brief explanation of how `Model.clean()` works:

1. **Custom Validation**: You can use `clean()` to define custom validation rules that are not enforced at the database level. These rules can be more complex than simple field-level validations, allowing you to check combinations of fields or perform checks across related objects.
    
2. **Data Cleaning**: In addition to validation, you can use `clean()` to clean and sanitize the data before saving it. For example, you can format data, convert values, or handle corner cases to ensure the data is in the expected format.
    
3. **Error Handling**: If any validation fails within the `clean()` method, you can raise a `ValidationError` to indicate that the data is invalid. This will prevent the model from being saved to the database, and the error can be captured and handled appropriately in your application.
    
4. **Pre-Save Hook**: `clean()` is called automatically by Django during the model's validation process before saving the data. It's a pre-save hook that gives you the opportunity to intervene and modify the data or perform additional checks.

the `clean()` method in Django models should not return a value. Instead, it should raise a `ValidationError` if there is any issue with the data and needs to prevent the model instance from being saved.

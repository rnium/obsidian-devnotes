- Worker process is asynchronus.

- Set `worker_processes` directive value of the main context to `auto`, as it will set it to as many number of worker processes as many cores the processor has.
- Set `worker_connections` under `event` context, to the maximum number of files the server can open at once. Run the command `ulimit -n` to see the limit.

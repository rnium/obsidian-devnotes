1. **Context:** sections within the configuration where directives can be set (same as scope)
	1. Nested context inherits from their parents.
	2. Context types:
		1. The topmost context is the configuration file itself (the *`main context`*). Here we configure the global directives that apply to the master process.
		2. the *`http`* context
		3. the *`server`* context: where we define virtual host
		4. the *`location`* context: for matching uri locations for incoming requests to the parent server context.
2. **Directives:** specific configuration options (name-value pair)

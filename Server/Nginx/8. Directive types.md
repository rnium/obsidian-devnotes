### Three directive types:
1. Array Directive
	-  Can be specified multiple times without overriding a previous setting
	- Gets inherited by all child contexts
	- Child context can override inheritance by re-declaring directive
	- example: `access_log`
2. Standard Directive:
	- Can only be declared once. A second declaration overrides the first
	- Gets inherited by all child contexts
	- Child context can override inheritance by re-declaring directive
	- example: `root`
3.  Action Directive:
	- Invokes an action such as a rewrite or redirect
	- Inheritance does not apply as the request is either stopped (redirect/response) or re-evaluated (rewrite)
	- example: `return`
